<h1>MyFaces.news</h1>
This is my first react-native app

It's a kind of experiment. I worked on it during the COVID lock down.

By developing this app I learned:
- react
- react-native
- react-navigation
- React Hooks
- React Context
- Expo.io
- axios
- AsyncStorage
- Visual Studio Code
- Adobe Illustrator
- more .....

The app is a prototype of a news-based social network.

Cooming Soon on the App Sotere. 

For now you can clone it and use it. So: expo start and enjoy.
